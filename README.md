## Description

Stash is a free image hosting app created with the T3 Stack (Next.js, TRPC, Prisma, and TailwindCSS). Users can upload as
many images as they want (up to 150MB at a time), and sort them into folders if they wish. Basic image editing is also 
supported (cropping, rotation, and drawing). If you choose to upload images without signing in, you will retain all of your
previously uploaded images on your new account.
