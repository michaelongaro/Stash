## Description

Stash is a free image hosting app created with the T3 Stack (Next.js, TRPC, Prisma, and TailwindCSS). Users can upload as
many images as they want (up to 150MB at a time), and sort them into folders if they wish. Basic image editing is also 
supported (cropping, rotation). If you choose to upload images without signing in, and then create an account, all of your
previously uploaded images will be transferred to your new account.
